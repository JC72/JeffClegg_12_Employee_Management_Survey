Once node index.js is run, the application uses will prompt the user in the command line with a series of questions about your GitHub and about your project.

The application then takes your response for what you want to do then take the user to the next prompts based off their choice. From there, the application will take the information and run specific queries using mySQL and either runs a select, insert, delete or update query. Based off the selections the user can add employees, departments or roles. They can also view all the information, delete information, or update specific information in mySql database.
